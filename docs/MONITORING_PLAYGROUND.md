**Panels to create:**
```
📊 Panel 1: "Service Health Grid"
Query: up
Visualization: Table
Transform: Show service name and status

🎯 Panel 2: "Uptime Percentage"  
Query: (count(up == 1) / count(up)) * 100
Visualization: Gauge
Min: 0, Max: 100
Unit: Percent

📈 Panel 3: "Activity Timeline"
Query: rate(prometheus_http_requests_total[5m])

### **🎨 Exercise 2: The "Command Center" Dashboard**

**Goal:** Build something that looks like NASA mission control!

**Panels:**
```
🚨 Panel 1: "Alert Status" (Red/Green indicators)
🔥 Panel 2: "Live Metrics Stream" (Real-time numbers)
📊 Panel 3: "Performance Graphs" (Multiple time series)
💾 Panel 4: "Resource Usage" (Gauges and bars)
```

**Make it look awesome with:**

## 🧪 **Prometheus Query Laboratory**

### **🔬 Beginner Experiments:**

```promql
# Experiment 1: Count things
count(up)                    # How many services exist?
count(up == 1)              # How many are healthy?
count(up == 0)              # How many are down?

# Experiment 2: Filter things  
up{job="minio"}             # Just MinIO health
up{job!="prometheus"}       # Everything except Prometheus

# Experiment 3: Math operations
up * 100                    # Convert to percentage
sum(up)                     # Total of all values
avg(up)                     # Average uptime
```

### **🔬 Intermediate Experiments:**

```promql
# Time-based operations
rate(prometheus_http_requests_total[5m])     # Requests per second
increase(prometheus_http_requests_total[1h]) # Total requests in last hour

# Advanced filtering
prometheus_http_requests_total{handler="/metrics"}  # Specific endpoint
prometheus_http_requests_total{code="200"}          # Only successful requests

# Aggregation magic
sum by (job) (up)           # Group health by service type
max(up)                     # Highest value (should be 1)
min(up)                     # Lowest value (should be 0 if any service down)
```

### **🔬 Advanced Experiments:**

```promql
# Calculate percentiles (when you have histogram data)
histogram_quantile(0.95, prometheus_http_request_duration_seconds_bucket)

# Predict the future! (Linear prediction)
predict_linear(up[1h], 3600)

# Rate calculations
rate(prometheus_http_requests_total[5m]) * 60  # Requests per minute
```

## 🎪 **Fun Visualization Experiments**

### **🎪 Try Different Chart Types:**

**For the same query (`up`), try:**
1. **Stat** - Big numbers
2. **Gauge** - Speedometer style  
3. **Bar gauge** - Horizontal bars
4. **Table** - Spreadsheet view
5. **Time series** - Line graph
6. **State timeline** - Status over time

**🤯 See how the SAME data can tell completely different stories!**

### **🎪 Color Psychology in Dashboards:**

```
🟢 Green = Good, healthy, success
🟡 Yellow = Warning, caution, needs attention  
🔴 Red = Critical, error, immediate action needed
🔵 Blue = Information, neutral, stable
🟣 Purple = Special, premium, advanced features
```

**Try changing colors and see how it affects the "feeling" of your dashboard!**

## 🎯 **Real-World Scenarios to Practice**

### **🚨 Scenario 1: "The Service Outage"**

**Simulate:** Stop Redis service
```bash
docker-compose stop redis
```

**Your Task:**
1. Watch your dashboard turn red
2. Create an alert that would notify you
3. Write a query to show "time since last failure"
4. Restart the service and watch recovery

**Learn:** How real incidents look in monitoring

---

### **📈 Scenario 2: "The Traffic Spike"**

**Simulate:** Generate lots of requests
```powershell
# Run this in PowerShell
1..100 | ForEach-Object { 
    Invoke-WebRequest "http://localhost:9090/metrics" -UseBasicParsing | Out-Null
    Start-Sleep -Milliseconds 50
}
```

**Your Task:**
1. Watch the request rate spike in Prometheus
2. Create a panel showing requests per minute
3. Set up an alert for "high traffic"

**Learn:** How to monitor and alert on traffic patterns

---
