## 🎨 **STEP 1: Your First Grafana Adventure (15 minutes)**

### **A. Import Your First Professional Dashboard**

1. **In Grafana** (already open at http://localhost:3001):
   ```
   👆 Click the "+" icon (top left)
   👆 Select "Import"
   👆 Click "Upload JSON file" 
   👆 Browse to: infrastructure/docker/grafana/dashboards/infrastructure-overview.json
   👆 Click "Import"
   ```

2. **🎉 BOOM! You now see:**
   - 🟢 Green dots = Your services are healthy!
   - 📊 Real-time graphs updating every 5 seconds
   - 💾 Storage usage from MinIO
   - 📋 A professional table of all services

### **B. Play with Time Ranges (Super Fun!)**

```
👆 Click the time picker (top right)
👆 Try these options:
   - "Last 5 minutes" - See very recent data
   - "Last 1 hour" - See more history
   - "Last 6 hours" - See longer trends
```

**🔥 Watch how the graphs change!** Each time range tells a different story!

### **C. Create Your First Custom Panel**

1. **Click "Add Panel" button**
2. **In the query box, type:** `up`
3. **Change visualization to "Stat"**
4. **In the right panel:**
   - Title: "My Services Health Check"
   - Unit: "Short"
   - Color scheme: "Green-Yellow-Red (by value)"
5. **Click "Apply"**

**🎯 You just created your first monitoring panel! You're officially a Grafana user!**

## 🔬 **STEP 2: Prometheus Exploration (20 minutes)**

### **A. Understanding Your Data Source**

**Open Prometheus** (http://localhost:9090) in another tab:

1. **Try these magical queries** (copy-paste them!):

```promql
# See all your services (basic health check)
up

# See which services are being monitored
up{job!=""}

# Check MinIO specifically
up{job="minio"}

# See Prometheus monitoring itself (meta!)
prometheus_notifications_total
```

2. **For each query:**
   - 👆 Click "Execute" 
   - 👆 Click "Graph" tab to see time-series
   - 👆 Try different time ranges

### **B. Your First PromQL Magic** ✨

```promql
# Count how many services are UP
count(up == 1)

# Count how many services are DOWN  
count(up == 0)

# Calculate uptime percentage
(count(up == 1) / count(up)) * 100

# See rate of change (very advanced!)
rate(prometheus_http_requests_total[5m])
```

**🤯 Each query reveals different insights about your system!**

### **C. Understanding the Results**

When you see:
- **`up 1`** = Service is healthy ✅
- **`up 0`** = Service is down ❌  
- **Numbers changing** = Data is live and updating
- **Flat lines** = Stable system
- **Spikes** = Something interesting happened

Title: "Services Status Overview"
Unit: Short
Value mappings:
  - 0 → "DOWN ❌" (Red)
  - 1 → "UP ✅" (Green)
```

### **C. Panel 2: "Live Activity Monitor"**

```
Query: rate(prometheus_http_requests_total[5m])
Visualization: Time series
Title: "Prometheus Activity (Live!)"
Y-axis: "Requests/second"
```

### **D. Panel 3: "Storage Health"**

```
Query: minio_cluster_usage_total_bytes
Visualization: Gauge
Title: "Storage Usage"
Unit: Bytes
Max value: 10000000000 (10GB)
Thresholds:
  - Green: 0-5GB
  - Yellow: 5-8GB  
  - Red: 8-10GB
```

### **E. Save Your Masterpiece**

```
👆 Click "Save" (top right)
👆 Name it: "My First Awesome Dashboard"
👆 Click "Save"
```

**🎨 You just created a custom professional dashboard! You're amazing!**

## 🚨 **STEP 4: Set Up Your First Alert (15 minutes)**

Let's make your system **SMART** - it will tell you when something goes wrong!

### **A. Create a Simple Alert**

1. **In Grafana:**
   ```
   👆 Go to "Alerting" → "Alert Rules"
   👆 Click "New Rule"
   ```

2. **Configure the alert:**
   ```
   Rule name: "Service Down Alert"
   Query: up == 0
   Condition: IS ABOVE 0
   Evaluation: Every 10s for 30s
   ```

3. **Add notification:**
   ```
   👆 Click "Add action"
   👆 Select "Email" (or create webhook for Slack later)
   👆 Message: "🚨 ALERT: Service {{$labels.job}} is DOWN!"
   ```

### **B. Test Your Alert**

```bash
# Let's stop one service to trigger the alert!
docker-compose stop redis
```

**Wait 30 seconds... Your alert should trigger! 🚨**

```bash
# Then start it back up
docker-compose start redis
```
