## 🚨 **Troubleshooting Guide**

### **Common Issues & Solutions**

**🔴 SSL Certificate Not Working**
```bash
# Check Traefik logs
docker logs ai-comics-proxy

# Verify DNS is pointing to server
dig jakekoks.fun

# Check Let's Encrypt rate limits
# Wait 1 hour and restart Traefik
docker-compose restart traefik
```

**🔴 Service Not Accessible**
```bash
# Check if service is running
docker ps | grep [service-name]

# Check service logs
docker logs [container-name]

# Check if ports are open
netstat -tlnp | grep :443
```

**🔴 Database Connection Issues**
```bash
# Test database connection
docker exec ai-comics-db psql -U comics_user -d ai_comics_db -c "SELECT 1;"

# Check environment variables
docker exec ai-comics-backend env | grep DATABASE
```

**🔴 Grafana Not Loading**
```bash
# Check Grafana container
docker logs ai-comics-grafana
