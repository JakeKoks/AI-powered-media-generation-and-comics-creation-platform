## 📊 **Grafana Basics - Learning Path**

### **🎯 Level 1: Explorer (Beginner)**

**What is Grafana?**
Grafana is like a "dashboard for your apps" - it shows you beautiful charts and graphs about how your system is performing in real-time!

**Your First Steps:**
1. **📈 Explore Tab**: Click "Explore" in left menu
2. **🔍 Data Source**: Select "Prometheus" 
3. **📝 Try These Queries**:
   ```
   up                           # Which services are running
   http_requests_total          # How many API calls you've made
   process_memory_resident_bytes # Memory usage
   ```
4. **▶️ Run Query**: Click blue "Run Query" button
5. **🎨 Visualization**: Switch between Table/Graph views

### **🎯 Level 2: Dashboard Creator (Intermediate)**

**Create Your First Dashboard:**
1. **➕ New Dashboard**: Click "+" → "Dashboard"
2. **📊 Add Panel**: Click "Add Panel"
3. **🎨 Panel Options**:
   - **Query**: Enter `up` to see service status
   - **Visualization**: Try "Stat", "Graph", "Gauge"
   - **Title**: Name it "Service Health"
4. **💾 Save**: Click "Save" (top right)

**Pre-built Metrics You Can Use:**
```bash
# System Health
up                                    # Services online/offline
rate(http_requests_total[5m])        # Request rate per second
http_request_duration_seconds        # Response times
process_cpu_seconds_total            # CPU usage
node_memory_MemAvailable_bytes       # Available memory

# Your AI Comics App
ai_comics_active_users               # Active users
ai_comics_generated_total            # Comics created
ai_comics_errors_total               # Error count
```

### **🎯 Level 3: Monitoring Master (Advanced)**

**Create Professional Dashboards:**
1. **📋 Dashboard Templates**: Import community dashboards
2. **🔔 Alerts**: Set up notifications when things go wrong
3. **📊 Variables**: Make dynamic dashboards
4. **🎨 Custom Panels**: Beautiful visualizations

## 🎮 **Fun Learning Exercises**

### **🔍 Exercise 1: Health Monitor**
Create a panel showing which services are healthy:
- Query: `up`
- Visualization: "Stat"
- Goal: See 5 green "1" values (all services up)

### **📈 Exercise 2: API Activity**
Monitor your API usage:
- Query: `rate(http_requests_total[5m])`
- Visualization: "Graph" 
- Goal: See spikes when you test endpoints

### **💾 Exercise 3: Resource Usage**
Track system resources:
- Query: `process_memory_resident_bytes`
- Visualization: "Gauge"
- Goal: Monitor memory consumption
